    "The WHOAMI GUESSER is a simple Machine learning algorithm that uses a Naive Bayes classifier to guess who typed in a given chat message in a conversation. In this demonstration, I will have restricted it to 5 chatters; everyone in our SS team namely, Jim , Charlie, Debbie, Triveni and Amit. Thanks to the IRC logs, I believe I have enough data in order to descern patterns and word choices each one of us have consciously or subconsciously developed over the years. I wanted to do this as a one of my pet projects and seemed like so much fun! I will share with you some interesting facts about you and your team mates that should be amusing. And Offcourse, this may by no means be perfect but the premise for this project seemed way to appealing to me to let it slide by without any acting on it! I hope this brings a smile on your faces! :) Enjoy!!!  "

      "[06/05 11:46] <triveni> i was trying to find abline in yesterday's diary.. not sure whether it will be still dere.\n",
      "[06/05 11:46] <dsk_hbe> in the case of the ticket I own, it's because the eclipse daily processing application failed it.  The ablines are in SDIGPM.  SDI is another name for the Classic Eclipse system\n",
      "[06/05 11:47] <triveni> ok\n",
      "[06/05 11:47] <triveni> I ll keep a note of SDI then.\n",
      "[06/05 11:47] <dsk_hbe> and it is such an old, virtually obsolete system, that I likely won't spend much time trying to train you guys on it.\n",
      "[06/05 11:47] <triveni> ok\n",
      "[06/05 11:49] <dsk_hbe> in fact what I am contemplating on this current issue is basically ignoring it.  I found a code bug that just waited for our menus to grow big enough to hit it... wayne agreed with my findings.  What I am thinking of doing is locking searches and only doing anythign about them if a user complains.  All internals and odds are very few even realize they still have searches in thsi old system\n",
      "[06/05 11:50] <triveni> its a scheduled search right?\n",
      "[06/05 11:50] <triveni> do they run daily..\n",
      "[06/05 11:51] <dsk_hbe> it's not like the PQS system.  For classic eclipse, the searches all run in the morning in the same batch.\n",
      "[06/05 11:51] <dsk_hbe> we used to have things called intra-days, but none of those anymore\n",
      "[06/05 11:51] <dsk_hbe> there are only 1,039 classic eclipse searches left out there\n",
      "[06/05 11:52] <triveni> ok\n",
      "[06/05 11:52] <dsk_hbe> IN PQS land it's not unusual for a single user to have that many of his own ;-)\n",
      "[06/05 11:53] <triveni> and they use SA copies\n",
      "[06/05 11:53] <triveni> or SR copies\n",
      "[06/05 11:53] <triveni> i mean the eclipse searches\n",
      "[06/05 11:53] <dsk_hbe> the searches are kicked off in teh LSA, but still do the actual search processing via the LSR\n",
      "[06/05 11:54] <triveni> ok \n",
      "[06/05 11:56] <\u000306Amit_zOS\u000f> I didn't know that eclipse is a different class of search itself.. was under the impression that eclipse is a system that carried out the PQS searches\n",
      "[06/05 11:57] <dsk_hbe> well, in teh web/PQS world, they do call their searches PQs (persistent queries)... but in Classic Eclipse we just call ours Eclipses... why do you need two names? ;-) \n",
      "[06/05 11:58] <dsk_hbe> you have to remember that Classic was around much longer than the web world... some naming conventions got carried forward as they built the web products, some they changed just to be different ;-)\n",
      "[06/05 11:58] <dsk_hbe> or some other less politically correct word ;-)\n",
      "[06/05 11:58] <\u000306Amit_zOS\u000f> so under the hood, both are the same really\n",
