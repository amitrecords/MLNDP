    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. Decsion Tree Classifier\n",
    "    - This classifier can be used to distinguish between different species of fishes like samon and\n",
    "      bass based on their features like length, width, color etc.\n",
    "    - The Decision tree classifiers works well for classification problems where there are a finite\n",
    "      number of discreete target variables/possibilities. With decision tree's its possible to graphically represent the\n",
    "      decision making process in the sense that all nodes can be viewed as a user made decision and the tree as a whole \n",
    "      covers all alternatives. Among the three algorithms I have chosen, Decision trees are the fastest. It allows for \n",
    "      classification without any significant computation. It works well with classification problems and is tremendously \n",
    "      useful in the cases where a user needs to understand and eliminate any ambiguity in decsion making. \n",
    "    - The major strength of decsion trees is in classification problems with discreete valued outcomes. For continuous\n",
    "      valued regression problems however, decision tree's may not be the best choice. One other weakness of this model\n",
    "      is that all segments of the decision boundary would be parallel to one of the feature axes and hence cannot\n",
    "      formulate any complex decision boundaries. The decision tree's algorithm is very sensitive to outliers or noisy\n",
    "      data and this also leaves a lot of room for overfitting. \n",
    "    - Firstly, the problem at hand is a classification problem with two possible outcomes. There are about 103 features after  \n",
    "      One-Hot encoding which means this problem is of very high dimensionality. Secondly, the training dataset in our problem \n",
    "      is fairly large. Given these two conditions of high dimensionality and large datasets, Decision tree's certainly jumps \n",
    "      out as a promising choice because of it performs well on such datasets and increase in dimensionality does not affect \n",
    "      the training time for such an algorithm. Also, decision trees are able to handle numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "      Lastly, I would expect Decision tree's to be computationally less costlier than K- Nearest Neighbor or SVM classifiers.\n",
    "2. K Nearest Neighbor Classifier\n",
    "    - This classifier can be used to distinguish between gesture strokes and non-gesture strokes within the mechanical \n",
    "      device description sketches. Gesture strokes do not form a part of the device but help in the illustration of the\n",
    "      design and working of the device such as arrows, circles, lines used to seperate parts of sketches etc. \n",
    "      Non-gesture strokes are the strokes that form a part of the device. We could use features like length of strokes,\n",
    "      their speed, curvature etc.\n",
    "    - This algorithm a non parametric model that cannot be characterized by a set of parameters and falls under the\n",
    "      category of instance based learning. The cost of learning for this algorithm is 0. Again, this algorithm works \n",
    "      well for classification problems than the regression problems.\n",
    "    - The model cannot be interpretted like we could in the Decision Tree's. There is no description of a learned \n",
    "      concept heree since it's almost memorizing the datasets. And also, it could be computationally expensive to \n",
    "      calculate the K nearest neighbors if the dataset is large.\n",
    "    - The large training dataset in our problem and the low cost of training for the Nearest neighbor classifier makes it a\n",
    "      good choice for a classifier. Besides, it would also be interesting to see how it fares agains the decision tree\n",
    "      algorithm.\n",
    "3. Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - We could use the SVM classifier to predict weather a transaction using a particular credit card is fraudulent or \n",
    "      not based on the time of transaction, place, nature etc.\n",
    "    - The SVM classifier is generally known to produce accurate classifiers for binary classification since depending on \n",
    "      the kernel it could find any hyperplane (if it exists) that could linearly seperate the two classes. This \n",
    "      classifier is also robust to noise and there is less overfitting.\n",
    "    - This classifier is a binary classifier and if we had more than two classes, we would have to run one class against \n",
    "      all other classes and repeat the process multiple times in order to segregate all the classes. They are also \n",
    "      computationally expensive and may run slow depending on the size of the input dataset and the number of features.\n",
    "    - SVM is good at forming complex learning boundaries and is usually produces a very accurate predictor. This is a \n",
    "      standard linear predictor for predicting a categorical variable with less than 100 K samples. I wanted to see how much \n",
    "      of a difference in accuracy this algorithm would provide considering the fact that this is a high dimensional dataset \n",
    "      and that SVC would probably take longer to train."

    "**Answer: ** Based on the initial model evaluations and the graphs plotted above, I believe that the Decision Tree Classifier performs the best out of the three that I had chosen. This is supported firstly, by the fact that the Decision Tree classifier takes the least amount of time learning the model as well as predicting with the latest model. Considering this, along with the fact that the difference between the algorithm with the highes f-score (K-Nearest Neighbor) on 100% of the training set and that of the Decision tree is less than 0.0028 makes it a better choice. Both SVC and K-Nearest neighbors are expensive to train and/or test because there are about 103 features. SVC takes over 2 minutes to learn the model while both SVC and KNN take more than 20 seconds to predict. If we take the example of KNN, we see that it takes about 27 seconds to predict an outcome for just an increase of just 0.3% in fscore than we get from Decision Trees. Moreover, Decision tree's suite well to this data because it can easily accomodate the large number of features in this data and since there are only two output classes, decision tree's is easily able to fileter out and create branches that eliminate any entropy in the child  leaves."

    "**Answer: ** Decision tree learning uses a representative predictal model in the form of a tree with nodes and branches with leaves attached to it which may further be framed as nodes branching into leaves thus forming a tree. In this predictive model, each node can be intepreted as a decision criteria based on the value of one or more input variables/features and resulting into leaves that represent the input samples that satisfy that criterion and those that don't. And then, a decision criterion is formed such that this criterion is able to divide the data into positive and negative samples (in case of a binary classifier). The aim for an effective decision tree is to form nodes that represent an important decision that is able to segregate the input samples into target variables that is the most representative of the output classes. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees. Once an effective decision tree is developed/learnt using an input training set, the same decisions can be used to filter out the new testing samples into their appropriate target classes.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.

    "**Answer:** Once we remove many features and just use the most important features to learn and train the classifier, we get a better accuracy score for a marginal drop in the F-score of the model on the testing data. I would certainly consider the reduced data as my training set because, of of the time saved in training for just a difference of 0.0024 drop of f-score and a much more significant increase in the accuracy score (0.0307)."
